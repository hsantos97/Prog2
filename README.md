##  Data abstraction 
 - Separation between interface and Implementation
## Inheritance 
 - Modeling relationships between similar types
## Dynamic linking
 - Use of similar objects, ignoring
details that make them different
## Polymorphism:
 - Ability of an object to behave in different ways, generate a different result when the same method is invoked
## Friend function
 - Function defined outside a class, but which has access to its private and protected members
## Exceptions
 - The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed
